# VR Solar System (Unity)
 This repo holds individual branches for my own and [Bruhmao's](https://github.com/Bruhmao "My partner's GitHub Profile") 3rd Year Physics Project: Virtual Reality Solar System.

 The main branch is likely to fulfil a presentation/demonstration purpose, whilst the individual branches serve as seperate workspaces where contribution and collaboration can be tracked and seen easily during the review and report-writing process.

 Summaries of each project will be below, built upon the core task of simulating our solar system.

 ## VRSS: Collision and Orbital Dynamics (*TBC*) by @CASE-R
As of January 2022, this branch of the project is to explore the dynamics of collisions and orbits within our Solar System from sudden influences. 

The intention is to provide the ability to alter properties of stellar bodies, and apply external forces allowing the user to create unique scenarios to fulfill curiousity.

```This change is to test the creation of branches```
