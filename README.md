# VR Solar System (Unity)
 This repo holds individual branches for my own and [Bruhmao's](https://github.com/Bruhmao "My partner's GitHub Profile") 3rd Year Physics Project: Virtual Reality Solar System.

 The main branch is likely to fulfil a presentation/demonstration purpose, whilst the individual branches serve as seperate workspaces where contribution and collaboration can be tracked and seen easily during the review and report-writing process.

 Rather than working seperately, the decision is to now work on the same simulation working together on the underlying theory and decisions. Each branch will continue to function as seperate cloud storage for our workspaces

 ## Project Timeline
 ### Week 1
 Tested different methods of creating Newtonian gravity between game objects by using RigidBody components and some custom code to apply Newton's 2nd Law. This was taken further by beginning to initiate orbital motion.

 ### Week 2
 Students were sent off to investigate the dimensions and units used in Unity and how this compares to reality and the value/dimensions of the gravitational constant ***G***.
